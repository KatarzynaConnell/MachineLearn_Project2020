Static folder
Folder with the html code for the end user interface

Dockerfile 
which allow effortless sharing of the code with other users

requirements.txt
File what python packages necessary to run the web app

polynomial_model.pkl
file containing the trained model in the pickle format

powerproduction.csv
csv file with data set 

.gitignore file
tells git which files to ignore

.dockerignore
